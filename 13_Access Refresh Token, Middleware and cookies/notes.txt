An Access Token and a Refresh Token are two types of credentials commonly used in modern authentication systems, especially with OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect.

Access Token:

An access token is a short-lived credential issued by an authentication server after a user successfully logs in.
It is used by the client (such as a web or mobile app) to access protected resources or APIs on behalf of the user.
Access tokens usually have a limited lifespan (e.g., 15 minutes to 1 hour) for security reasons.
When the access token expires, the client cannot access the protected resources until it obtains a new token.
Refresh Token:

A refresh token is a long-lived credential also issued by the authentication server along with the access token.
Its main purpose is to allow the client to obtain a new access token without requiring the user to log in again.
When the access token expires, the client sends the refresh token to the authentication server to request a new access token.
Refresh tokens are typically stored securely and are not sent with every API request.
If a refresh token is compromised, an attacker could obtain new access tokens, so they must be protected carefully.
Summary:

Access tokens grant temporary access to resources.
Refresh tokens allow the client to get new access tokens without user intervention.
Together, they improve both security and user experience in authentication systems.
