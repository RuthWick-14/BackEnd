we have to modify the registerUser

get user details from frontend
validation - not empty
check if user already exists: username, email
check for images, check for avatar
upload them to cloudinary, avatar
create user object - create entry in db
remove password and refres token field from response
check for user user creation 
return response

we have create this algorithms

import upload object from user.routes.js with the help of multer

see new lines of code in user.routes.js

import user object for validation 

import uploadOnCloudinary to upload files on cloudinary

check the mistake, we missed await syntax in user.models.js then see bcrypt, also export apiResponse in ApiResponse.js

understand algorithms created in user.controller.js
