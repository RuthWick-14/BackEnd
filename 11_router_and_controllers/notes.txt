create file "user.controller.js" in controller folder

create "file user.routes.js" in routes folder

see these file and understand what code trying to say 

"
//routes import
import userRouter from './routes/user.routes.js';

//routes decleration
app.use("api/v1/users", userRouter)

export {app};
"
this is the standard practise of writing code 

Here the working is, the 2nd syntax of the above code is using middleware to perform the next with the selected router in user.routes.js 

in user.controller.js we are using asyncHandler to handle the backend to chekc if it is working or not.
