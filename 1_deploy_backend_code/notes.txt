This utility will walk you through creating a package.json file.
It only covers the most common items, and tries to guess sensible defaults.

See `npm help init` for definitive documentation on these fields
and exactly what they do.

Use `npm install <pkg>` afterwards to install a package and
save it as a dependency in the package.json file.

Press ^C at any time to quit.

Is this OK? (yes)





*******************************

change test in  package.json to start "node index.js"

then start write "npm run start" in terminal.

then install express.js in this folder

now type "npm run start".

congratulations, you have create a server.

Now to store the sensitive information we must install dotenv by typing "npm i dotenv"

now type sensitive variable in the .env

now type "require('dotenv').config()" in index.js

then write "port" to "process.env.PORT" in add.listen

Now you did the production ready (actually the server is running on .env PORT, i.e. 3000 not 4000)

let start deployment.

make git repo of this file. Also add file of .gitignore to ignore some files
