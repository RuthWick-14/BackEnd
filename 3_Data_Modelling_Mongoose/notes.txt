before storing data, first we need to create model of the data with the help of pen and paper.

create backend folder, then install express and mongoose

create "models" folder and inside that "todos" folder as an example

inside todos folder create "user.models.js", "todo.models.js" and "sub_todo.models.js".

in sub_todo.models.js or any we'll always remember three lines of code that is "
import mongoose from "mongoose";

const userSchema = new mongoose.Schema({});

export const User = mongoose.model("User", userSchema);
"

in MongoDB it is practiced that whenever we create data in schema, it converts in to plural with lowercases, i.e. User ----> users.

go to mongoose docs

now create schema in any of three files like username, email, etc.

we can write "username: String" but for more productivity we write "        
username : {
            type : String,     
            required : true,    //this data is must required
            unique: true,       //this username should be unique
            lowercase : true,   //username should in lowercase
        },
"

we are working in the validation of data.

mongoose docs must to be read

also add secondary object called timestamp which tell us about createdAt and updatedAt.

To create reference from todo to user syntax would be like this "   
createdBy : {
        type : mongoose.Schema.Types.ObjectId,
        ref : "User"
    }
"

this "User" comes from model object string "User".

Create complete data model.
